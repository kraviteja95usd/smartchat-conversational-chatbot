    "**Text Generation Capability:** GPT has been specifically designed for generating the text, making it highly effective for producing logically reasoned responses in conversational contexts such as to-and-fro chats with chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Availability of Pre-trained Models:** Models like GPT-3 are pre-trained on extensive datasets. These kind of models deliver contextually appropriate responses on a wide range of topics without the need for extensive additional training.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adaptability and Versatility:** The GPT architecture's exposure to a variety of text sources, allows it to adjust to different conversational styles, thereby imprvoing the user interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Contextual Awareness:** GPT is very good at maintaining context throughout multiple chat exchanges. It leads to smoother and more continuous dialogues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation and Fine-tuning:** Making use of a pre-trained GPT model, we can conserve time and resources, as it demands less data and training compared to Seq2Seq models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance in Chatbot Applications:** GPT has shown exceptional capability in generating human-like responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering all these points, we have decided to go with the GPT architecture.\n",

    "**Pain points to be noticed:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The trained GPT2-Medium model actually predicted more information than the required information. For example: let's says there is a question `Where does the Sun rise?`. The usual answer is `East`. But it predicted as `The Sun rises in the East`.\n",
    "- We lost the accuracy and the answers that were being predicted, are not as expected as mentioned in the above method.\n",
    "- Due to the single directional context understanding, GPT2-medium model does not have good understanding of the the text patterns from SQuAD dataset, even though it is trained with millions of parameters.\n",
    "- We trained data on GPT2-Medium model without passing the `ans_start` and `ans_end` variables to the train set. This could also be one of the reasons. And due to the text generation nature of GPT2-Medium model, we are unable to achieve as expected.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Description of Parameters**: The function requires two inputs: the question posed and the context with pertinent information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Restriction on Context Size**: A limit is placed on the size of the context to prevent it from surpassing the model's input processing capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Context Chunking**: The context is segmented into smaller segments (or chunks) that have a maximum specified size. This enables effective processing without burdening the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Collection of Answers**: A blank list is created in order to save possible answers taken from each section of the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Loop for Chunk Processing**: Perform actions for every chunk of context.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model requires the chunk and question to be converted to a suitable format. This involves transforming them into a numerical format while making sure they stay within the maximum context size.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Generating Predictions**: The model analyzes the tokenized input to produce predictions on the location of the answer's start and end in the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The forecasts for the start and conclusion of the answer span are acquired.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Locating Answer Tokens**: The function searches for the tokens that have the highest predicted scores for the start and end positions of the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Information Retrieval**: The tokens that have been recognized are transformed into a legible string format in order to create the answer. This includes gathering the tokens predicted to start and end, then combining them to form a coherent response.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Merging Responses**: Once all chunks have been processed, the answers obtained from each chunk are merged together to form a unified response.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Strengths and Tasks performed uniquely compared with GPT2-medium approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "***Unlike GPT2-medium approach:***\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, unlike the GPT2-medium approach, we have achieved great results when we applied BERT's bert-based-uncased model. Look at the following points on what we had followed to acheive this.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here, we have uniquely followed by manually downloading the dataset, converting it to a dataframe and saving that file as well.\n",
    "- We haven't directly applied tokenization on the text data captured from the dataset. Instead, we performed some data cleaning before that.\n",
    "- We haven't used LoRA and PEFT techniques here. Instead, we used totally Pythonic approach to experiment how this model works by applying all the techniques using PyTorch library followed by the remaining ones.\n",
    "- As the requirement is to build the chatbot, we have to generate the text based answers for the context and question passed in. Here, we have not only considered the text generation point of view, but also we are responsible to manage the context and handle variety of topics while generating the text.\n",
    "- We made use of the `ans_start` and `ans_end` variables in the train dataset to capture the correct part of the answer.\n",
    "- This model has not ran into issues/errors while executing in MacBooks. This model is environment agnostic.\n",
    "- Though we don't have sufficient computational resources, we were able to achieve all the required results. Basically, we were able to validate all the 10570 rows of the validation dataset.\n",
    "- This model might not have great text generation capabilities compared with GPT2-medium model. But, it understands the context very well and can almost exactly predict the answers as expected, although there are some issues with the edge case rows alone (example: the answer of a row would be `[\"Newton was limited by Denver's defense\", 'Newton', 'Newton']`).\n",
    "- Validation loss was of minor but not that minor than GPT2-medium architecture. Still if we compare it in context management and variety topics handling point of view, BERT model was so good.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As I already mentioned in [this file](https://github.com/kraviteja95usd/smartchat-conversational-chatbot/blob/chatbot-by-ravi/SQuAD_using_gpt2-medium/squad_lora_gpt2_medium_validation.ipynb), please be informed that usually such type of Question-Answering datasets does not qualify for a conversational chatbot that supports multi-turn conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we had included the context-management as well as handling variety of topics. Let me explain them below.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ***Context Management***: We trained this model in such a way that if you just set the context once and ask multiple questions one after the other, it will definitely answer your questions based on that context. If at all you wish to change the context, just change it and ask the questions accordingly.\n",
    "    - ***Handling Variety of topics***: Ofcourse we have handled this. Though we trained this using SQuAD dataset alone, even though you provide some random context from the internet and ask questions based on it, it will definitely answer your query.\n",

    "    \n",
    "- Let us take a look at the performance metrics scores of this model post predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ***BLEU Score(0.47)***: Usually, BLEU score explains the similarity between the actual and predicted texts. If a BLEU  score value is  0.47, it means that there is a moderate (47%) similarity between the actual and predicted texts. It captures certain important phrases or sequences of words, though not exact.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - ***ROUGE-1 (0.62)***: Assesses the similarity of individual words (unigrams) in the produced text and the reference. A score of 0.62 implies that approximately 62% of the individual words in the reference text are present in the generated output.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ***ROUGE-2 (0.37)***: Assesses the similarity of adjacent word pairs. A 0.37 score means approximately 37% of the bigrams from the reference are found in the generated output.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ***ROUGE-L (0.61)***: Takes into account the longest common subsequence (LCS) between the produced output and the reference. The score indicates that approximately 61% of the reference's content is accounted for by the longest matching sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Overall observation for ROUGE score is: the ROUGE scores indicate a moderate level of similarity between the generated responses and the reference answers, with better matching at the unigram level than at the bigram level.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Because, - As I already mentioned in [this file](https://github.com/kraviteja95usd/smartchat-conversational-chatbot/blob/chatbot-by-ravi/SQuAD_using_gpt2-medium/squad_lora_gpt2_medium_validation.ipynb), there are few edge case anwers in the validation dataset such as `[\"Newton was limited by Denver's defense\", 'Newton', 'Newton']`. Due to such reasons, along with using only the first 5 rows to predict, the ROUGE and BLEU scores were very low. But in general if you look at the above predicted results, this model has very well predicted the results.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Frequency distributions of both the actual and predicted answers' words are almost consistent from the histogram plotted above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pain points noticed and the tasks that were not performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Due to time constraints, we could not spend on handling the edge cases where multiple answers are available within the single question of the context in validation dataset (example: `[\"Newton was limited by Denver's defense\", 'Newton', 'Newton']`).\n",
    "- We might have lost the accuracy in terms of exactly matching the predicted answer with the actual answer. But still, I am very happy that the predicted answer is the correct one.\n",
    "- Due to computational resource and time constraints, we performed only the following items in minimal amount:\n",
    "    1. I could train only 3 epochs with sleepless nights with a very low level GPU that's embedded within my MacBook.\n",
    "    2. We are unable to achieve multi-turn conversations feature because.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, when we compare this approach with GPT2-medium approach, this has outperformed from its predictions, context management, handling variety of topics point of view.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT NOTE:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here, wherever I mention about ***not matching the predicted answer with actual answer*** means:\n",
    "    - It could be appending additional response either to the prefix or suffix area of the predicted answer.\n",
    "    - It could be because of predicted answer being displayed as `denver` and actual answer could be `Denver`.\n",
    "    - It could be because of predicted answer being displayed as `denver` and actual answer could be `['Denver', 'Denver', 'Denver']`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  But not from the obtained answer point of view.😊\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Improvement Suggestions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Try a hybrid mode of training. I mean - we can give a try to take 3 to 4 conversational dataset along with the current SQuAD one, train all of them to a single model, apply multi-turn conversational approaches and make it a complete chatbot. It should be similar to ChatGPT, perplexity.ai, blackbox.ai, Meta AI etc. etc.\n",
    "- Try obtaining some high computational power so that the the training and validation can be perfectly done."
